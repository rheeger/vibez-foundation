## 🚀 Agent-Based Development Approach

This project follows a coordinated multi-agent development approach. Each agent type can work independently on their domain while collaborating on shared interfaces and models.

### Agent Types

- **Frontend Engineering Agent**: Responsible for React components, UI implementation, and frontend state management
- **Interaction Design Engineer Agent**: Responsible for animations, user flows, sound design, and interactive experiences
- **Backend Engineering Agent**: Responsible for API development, database models, and integration with Endaoment DAAS
- **QA Testing Agent**: Responsible for test planning, implementation, and execution across all layers

### Agent-Specific Checklists

Detailed checklists for each agent type are available in separate documents:

- [Frontend Engineering Agent Checklist](./checklists/frontend-checklist.md)
- [Interaction Design Engineer Checklist](./checklists/interaction-checklist.md)
- [Backend Engineering Agent Checklist](./checklists/backend-checklist.md)
- [QA Testing Agent Checklist](./checklists/qa-checklist.md)

## 📋 Development Phases Overview

The project is divided into the following phases, with each agent having specific responsibilities and tasks in each phase:

### Phase 0: Shared Contract Development

During this phase, agents collaborate to define shared interfaces, models, and standards to ensure consistent implementation across domains.

### Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure

Each agent establishes the core infrastructure needed for their domain, setting up libraries, tools, and basic structures.

### Phase 2: Core User Flows

Agents implement essential platform functionality, focusing on authentication, fund creation, and basic user journeys.

### Phase 3: Donation and Impact Features

Development of the core philanthropic features, including donation workflows, grant management, and impact visualization.

### Phase 4: Educational and Community Features

Addition of engagement and educational content, social features, and community-oriented functionality.

### Phase 5: Refinement and Optimization

Focus on performance optimization, bug fixes, and enhancing the user experience across all domains.

### Phase 6: Launch Preparation

Final preparation for production deployment, including analytics, monitoring, and comprehensive documentation.
