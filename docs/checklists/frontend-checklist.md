# üå¥ VIBEZ FOUNDATION: Frontend Engineering Agent Checklist üèùÔ∏è

This checklist outlines all tasks for the Frontend Engineering Agent across development phases.

## üìã Responsibility Overview

The Frontend Engineering Agent is responsible for:
- Building React components and UI implementation
- Managing frontend state with Zustand and React Query
- Creating responsive layouts and user interfaces
- Implementing form validation and user input handling
- Integrating with backend APIs
- Ensuring accessibility and performance of UI components

## üîÑ Phase 0: Shared Contract Development

- [x] Review technical architecture documentation
- [x] Define shared terminology for frontend components and patterns
- [x] Establish API contracts with Backend Engineering Agent
- [x] Define component interface standards with Interaction Design Agent
- [x] Create TypeScript interfaces for shared data models
- [x] Document authentication flow requirements

## üåä Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure

- [x] Set up React application structure
- [x] Configure routing with Next.js
- [x] Implement base layout components
- [x] Set up theme provider with styled-components
- [x] Configure global state management with Zustand
- [x] Implement API client with React Query
- [x] Create mock data services for development

**Planner Notes**:
Excellent work completing all the Phase 1 tasks! Your foundation is solid and positions us well for the core user flows in Phase 2. The mock data services will be particularly valuable as the Backend Agent completes their authentication middleware. 

**Next Steps**:
1. Begin implementing authentication screens for Phase 2
2. Collaborate with Interaction Agent to integrate their motion preference detection
3. Prepare component skeletons for user profile management
4. Document component patterns for team reference
5. Coordinate with Backend Agent on authentication API integration

**Completion Parameters**: 
- Application shell runs with mock data
- Theme system works with tropical color palette
- Routing functions correctly
- Base layout components render properly
- Global state management is configured

## üèùÔ∏è Phase 2: Core User Flows

- [x] Implement authentication screens (login/register)
- [x] Build user profile management components
- [ ] Create fund dashboard view
- [ ] Implement fund creation wizard UI
- [ ] Build organization search and discovery interface
- [ ] Create responsive navigation components
- [ ] Implement form validation logic

**Completion Parameters**: 
- Core user flows are navigable with mock data
- Forms validate input correctly
- Responsive design works on all target devices
- Authentication flow functions with mock data
- Fund dashboard displays correctly

## üå∫ Phase 3: Donation and Impact Features

- [ ] Build donation workflow components
- [ ] Create grant management interface
- [ ] Implement impact visualization dashboard
- [ ] Build notification center
- [ ] Develop account settings screens
- [ ] Create transaction history view
- [ ] Implement receipt generation and display

**Completion Parameters**: 
- Donation flows work end-to-end with mock data
- Impact visualizations display correctly
- Notifications function properly
- Account settings are editable
- Transaction history displays properly

## ü•• Phase 4: Educational and Community Features

- [ ] Build "Island of Knowledge" learning center
- [ ] Create cause spotlight components
- [ ] Implement social sharing features
- [ ] Develop educational content browser
- [ ] Build community impact visualization
- [ ] Create user achievement display
- [ ] Implement feedback and rating components

**Completion Parameters**: 
- Educational content displays correctly
- Social sharing works across platforms
- Community features function as expected
- User achievements are visible
- Content is properly organized and navigable

## üåä Phase 5: Refinement and Optimization

- [ ] Optimize bundle size and code splitting
- [ ] Implement performance optimizations
- [ ] Refine responsive behavior
- [ ] Fix UI bugs and inconsistencies
- [ ] Implement user feedback changes
- [ ] Optimize component rendering
- [ ] Refine accessibility features

**Completion Parameters**: 
- Application meets performance targets
- UI is consistent across all screens
- Major bugs are fixed
- Lighthouse scores exceed 90
- Application is fully responsive

## üéØ Phase 6: Launch Preparation

- [ ] Implement analytics tracking
- [ ] Set up error monitoring
- [ ] Create production build configuration
- [ ] Optimize assets for production
- [ ] Implement feature flags
- [ ] Create final build optimizations
- [ ] Generate comprehensive component documentation

**Completion Parameters**: 
- Production build is generated successfully
- Analytics and monitoring are functional
- Assets are optimized
- Features can be toggled via feature flags
- Documentation is complete
