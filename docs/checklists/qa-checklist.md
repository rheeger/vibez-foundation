# üå¥ VIBEZ FOUNDATION: QA Testing Agent Checklist üèùÔ∏è

This checklist outlines all tasks for the QA Testing Agent across development phases.

## üìã Responsibility Overview

The QA Testing Agent is responsible for:
- Designing and executing comprehensive test plans
- Implementing automated tests (unit, integration, E2E)
- Verifying accessibility compliance
- Conducting performance and security testing
- Ensuring cross-browser and device compatibility
- Documenting issues and verifying fixes

## üîÑ Phase 0: Shared Contract Development

- [x] Review technical architecture documentation
- [x] Define testing strategy and approach
- [x] Establish test data requirements
- [x] Create test environment specifications
- [x] Define acceptance criteria standards
- [x] Document QA processes and workflows
- [x] Establish bug reporting templates

**Current Status**:
- Completed all Phase 0 tasks
- Created comprehensive testing strategy document
- Established test data requirements for all phases
- Defined clear acceptance criteria standards
- Created bug reporting templates and QA workflow documentation

**Documentation Created**:
- `docs/testing/testing-strategy.md` - Testing approach and methodology
- `docs/testing/test-data-requirements.md` - Test data specifications
- `docs/testing/acceptance-criteria.md` - Standards for feature acceptance
- `docs/testing/qa-workflow.md` - QA processes and procedures
- `docs/testing/bug-reporting-template.md` - Template for issue tracking

## üåä Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure

- [x] Set up testing frameworks (Jest, Cypress)
- [x] Create test plans for core functionality
- [ ] Establish CI test automation
- [x] Set up accessibility testing tools
- [x] Create test data generation utilities
- [ ] Configure test reporting
- [x] Implement initial smoke tests

**Planner Notes**:
Your Phase 0 work has created an excellent foundation for our testing approach. For Phase 1 completion, focus on finalizing the CI test automation and test reporting configuration. Work with the Backend Agent to ensure your test infrastructure properly integrates with their authentication middleware when it's complete.

**Next Steps**:
1. Complete CI test automation setup with GitHub Actions
2. Configure test reporting to provide clear results dashboards
3. Create automation scripts for accessibility testing
4. Begin drafting test plans for Phase 2 core user flows

**Current Status**:
- Jest and Cypress frameworks successfully configured
- Test plans created for foundation components
- Accessibility testing tools implemented (axe-core)
- Test data generation utilities working correctly
- Initial smoke tests running successfully
- Remaining tasks: CI automation and test reporting

**Completion Parameters**: 
- Test frameworks function
- CI pipeline runs basic tests
- Test plans documented for first features
- Accessibility testing tools are configured
- Test data can be generated programmatically
- Test reporting provides clear results
