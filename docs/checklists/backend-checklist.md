# üå¥ VIBEZ FOUNDATION: Backend Engineering Agent Checklist üèùÔ∏è

This checklist outlines all tasks for the Backend Engineering Agent across development phases.

## üìã Responsibility Overview

The Backend Engineering Agent is responsible for:
- Building API endpoints with Express and TypeScript
- Managing database models and migrations with Prisma
- Implementing authentication and authorization
- Integrating with Endaoment's DAAS platform
- Optimizing performance and implementing caching
- Ensuring security and data validation

## üîÑ Phase 0: Shared Contract Development

- [x] Review technical architecture documentation
- [x] Define API naming conventions and patterns
- [x] Establish data models and database schema
- [x] Define authentication and authorization approach
- [x] Document API contracts for Frontend Agent
- [x] Establish error handling standards
- [x] Define integration approach for Endaoment DAAS

**Current Status**: 
- Completed all Phase 0 tasks
- Created API naming conventions and patterns documentation
- Defined authentication and authorization approach
- Established error handling standards
- Documented API contracts for Frontend Agent
- Defined Endaoment DAAS integration approach
- Reviewed existing database schema and technical architecture

**Documentation Created**:
- `docs/technical/api-conventions.md` - API naming conventions
- `docs/technical/auth-approach.md` - Authentication and authorization approach
- `docs/technical/error-handling.md` - Error handling standards
- `docs/technical/api-contracts.md` - API contracts for Frontend
- `docs/technical/endaoment-integration.md` - Endaoment DAAS integration

## üåä Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure

- [x] Set up Express server with TypeScript
- [x] Configure Prisma ORM and database connections
- [x] Implement authentication middleware
- [x] Set up basic API structure and error handling
- [x] Create database schema migrations
- [x] Configure Redis for caching
- [x] Set up logging and monitoring

**Planner Notes**:
Great progress on the backend infrastructure! Authentication middleware is the final critical component needed to complete Phase 1. Consider using JWT for tokens and implement refresh token rotation for enhanced security. Ensure that the authentication system allows for different permission levels (admin, user) and integrates with our planned social authentication providers. 

**Next Steps**:
1. ~~Complete authentication middleware implementation with JWT~~
2. ~~Document authentication flow for Frontend and Interaction agents~~
3. ~~Create test cases for authentication endpoints~~
4. Prepare for Phase 2 by planning data models for fund management

**Current Status**: 
- Server runs locally with comprehensive error handling
- Database schema defined with Prisma ORM
- Express routes structure established with health check endpoint
- Logging system implemented with Winston
- Redis caching configured
- Graceful server shutdown implemented
- Authentication middleware implemented with JWT
- Role-based authorization added (user, admin roles)
- Authentication documentation created for frontend integration
- Test cases documented for authentication endpoints

**Completion Parameters**: 
- Server runs locally
- Database migrations work
- Basic health endpoint responds correctly
- Authentication middleware is functional
- Error handling is standardized
- Logging system captures relevant information

## üèùÔ∏è Phase 2: Core User Flows

- [ ] Implement user authentication API
- [ ] Create fund management endpoints (CRUD)
- [ ] Develop organization search and filtering API
- [ ] Integrate with Endaoment DAAS for fund creation
- [ ] Implement user profile management
- [ ] Create data validation middleware
- [ ] Implement pagination and sorting

**Completion Parameters**: 
- Core APIs function correctly
- Authentication works end-to-end
- Endaoment integration is verified with test accounts
- Data validation prevents invalid inputs
- Pagination works for list endpoints
- API responses follow standardized format

## üå∫ Phase 3: Donation and Impact Features

- [ ] Implement donation processing API
- [ ] Create grant management endpoints
- [ ] Develop transaction history API
- [ ] Build notification system
- [ ] Implement reporting and analytics endpoints
- [ ] Create email notification service
- [ ] Develop receipt generation

**Completion Parameters**: 
- Donation processing works with Endaoment
- Grants can be created and managed
- Transaction data is correctly stored and retrieved
- Notifications can be created and delivered
- Reporting endpoints return accurate data
- Email notifications are sent correctly

## ü•• Phase 4: Educational and Community Features

- [ ] Implement content management API
- [ ] Create social sharing endpoints
- [ ] Develop community metrics API
- [ ] Build recommendation system
- [ ] Implement educational progress tracking
- [ ] Create user achievement system
- [ ] Develop feedback and rating API

**Completion Parameters**: 
- Content management system works
- Social sharing functions correctly
- Community metrics are accurately calculated
- Recommendations are generated based on user activity
- Educational progress is tracked correctly
- Achievements are awarded based on criteria

## üåä Phase 5: Refinement and Optimization

- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Implement caching strategies
- [ ] Scale server resources appropriately
- [ ] Fix API bugs and edge cases
- [ ] Enhance error handling and logging
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Optimize API response times

**Completion Parameters**: 
- API response times meet targets
- Caching reduces load effectively
- Server resources are optimized
- Known bugs are fixed
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Error logs provide actionable information

## üéØ Phase 6: Launch Preparation

- [ ] Configure production environment
- [ ] Set up database backups
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Create deployment scripts
- [ ] Document API for partners
- [ ] Set up continuous deployment
- [ ] Create disaster recovery plan

**Completion Parameters**: 
- Production environment is configured
- Backup systems are in place
- Monitoring alerts are set up
- Deployment process is automated
- API documentation is complete
- Recovery procedures are documented
