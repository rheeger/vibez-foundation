This document provides essential context and best practices for AI agents working on interaction design and user experience for VIBEZ FOUNDATION.

## üåä Project Context

VIBEZ FOUNDATION is a tropical-themed Donor-Advised Fund provider built on Endaoment's DAFs as a Service platform. The user experience should embody a fun, Caribbean/reggae-inspired journey, making philanthropy feel like a relaxing island vacation while maintaining usability and accessibility.

## üß© Key Responsibilities

As an Interaction Design Engineer Agent, your primary responsibilities include:

1. Designing user flows and interaction patterns
2. Creating engaging animations and transitions
3. Implementing audio and motion effects
4. Ensuring intuitive and accessible interfaces
5. Prototyping interactive experiences
6. Collaborating with frontend and backend teams
7. Conducting usability testing

## üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Relaxed Engagement**: Create interactions that feel laid-back yet engaging
2. **Intuitive Discovery**: Make features easy to discover through natural exploration
3. **Tropical Delight**: Infuse every interaction with island-inspired delight
4. **Accessible Fun**: Ensure all users can enjoy the experience regardless of abilities
5. **Purposeful Motion**: Use animations to guide users and communicate meaning

### Brand Personality in Interactions

- **Vibrant**: Colorful, energetic feedback that's never boring
- **Relaxed**: Smooth, unhurried transitions that don't feel rushed
- **Inclusive**: Simple, clear interactions that work for everyone
- **Authentic**: Interactions that feel genuine and appropriate to the context
- **Playful**: Delightful surprises without being overwhelming

## üå∫ Interaction Patterns

### Navigation Concepts

- **Island Hopping**: Moving between major sections feels like traveling between islands
- **Wave Patterns**: Subtle wave animations for transitions between pages
- **Floating UI**: Elements that gently float or sway as if on water
- **Beach Pathways**: Clear visual paths that guide users through workflows

### Feedback Mechanisms

- **Tropical Sounds**: Subtle audio cues for interactions (optional for users)
- **Sand Ripples**: Visual feedback that ripples outward from touch/click points
- **Palm Tree Loading**: Loading indicators with swaying palm trees
- **Ocean Waves**: Progress bars that fill like water washing onto shore

### Form Interactions

- **Flow States**: Multi-step forms that feel like a journey rather than a task
- **Beach Cleanup**: Error recovery that feels like picking up litter (helpful, not punitive)
- **Tide Validation**: Form validation that ebbs and flows naturally with user input
- **Island Jumping**: Tab navigation between form sections

## üé® Animation Guidelines

### Timing & Easing

- Use slow, relaxed easings for transitions (ease-in-out, cubic-bezier)
- Primary transitions: 300-500ms duration
- Micro-interactions: 150-250ms duration
- Loading states: Gentle infinite animations that won't cause anxiety

### Motion Principles

- **Water-like Motion**: Smooth, flowing transitions between states
- **Gentle Sway**: Subtle movement to create a lively but relaxed feel
- **Natural Rhythm**: Timing that feels organic and unrushed
- **Directional Purpose**: Movements that guide attention and provide context

### Animation Types to Implement

1. **Page Transitions**: Wave-like motion between major page changes
2. **Element Entrance/Exit**: Gentle fades with slight movement
3. **Hover States**: Subtle scaling or color shifts
4. **Loading Indicators**: Tropical-themed loaders (palm trees, waves)
5. **Success Animations**: Celebrations with island elements
6. **Micro-interactions**: Small animations for buttons, toggles, and controls

### Animation Code Example

```tsx
// Wave-like page transition
const pageVariants = {
  initial: {
    opacity: 0,
    y: 50,
  },
  animate: {
    opacity: 1,
    y: 0,
    transition: {
      duration: 0.5,
      ease: [0.04, 0.62, 0.23, 0.98],
    },
  },
  exit: {
    opacity: 0,
    y: -50,
    transition: {
      duration: 0.3,
    },
  },
};

// Usage with framer-motion
<motion.div
  initial="initial"
  animate="animate"
  exit="exit"
  variants={pageVariants}
>
  {/* Page content */}
</motion.div>
```

## üéµ Audio Experience

### Background Music

- Implement subtle, low-volume reggae instrumentals
- Provide clear mute/volume controls
- Auto-pause when other audio is playing
- Remember user preferences
- Ensure seamless looping

### Interactive Sound Effects

- Gentle wave sounds for navigation
- Soft steel drum notes for success states
- Subtle tropical bird calls for notifications
- Quiet marimba tones for form interactions
- All sounds should be:
  - Subtle (never startling)
  - Optional (user can disable)
  - Purposeful (enhancing understanding)
  - Varied (not repetitive)

### Audio Implementation Example

```tsx
import { useSound } from 'use-sound';
import { useThemeStore } from '../stores/themeStore';

export const WaveButton = ({ children, onClick, ...props }) => {
  const { soundEnabled } = useThemeStore();
  const [playSound] = useSound('/sounds/wave-splash.mp3', { 
    volume: 0.5,
    interrupt: true,
    soundEnabled,
  });
  
  const handleClick = (e) => {
    playSound();
    if (onClick) onClick(e);
  };
  
  return (
    <Button onClick={handleClick} {...props}>
      {children}
    </Button>
  );
};
```

## üì± Responsive Interaction Design

3. **Donation Flow**
   - Organization discovery as island exploration
   - Amount selection with visual impact preview
   - Confirmation that feels like "sending a message in a bottle"
   - Tracking donation as a journey across water

### State Machine Examples

```tsx
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

// Fund creation state machine
export const fundCreationMachine = createMachine({
  id: 'fundCreation',
  initial: 'introduction',
  states: {
    introduction: {
      on: { NEXT: 'nameSelection' }
    },
    nameSelection: {
      on: { 
        NEXT: 'fundingSelection',
        BACK: 'introduction'
      }
    },
    fundingSelection: {
      on: { 
        NEXT: 'reviewDetails',
        BACK: 'nameSelection'
      }
    },
    reviewDetails: {
      on: { 
        SUBMIT: 'processing',
        BACK: 'fundingSelection',
        EDIT_NAME: 'nameSelection',
        EDIT_FUNDING: 'fundingSelection'
      }
    },
    processing: {
      on: { 
        SUCCESS: 'confirmation',
        ERROR: 'error'
      }
    },
    confirmation: {
      type: 'final'
    },
    error: {
      on: { RETRY: 'processing' }
    }
  }
});
```
